# Priority Tasks

This application demonstrates an organization system based on priority. The entire web app is created in React, and we use 'useReducer' for better organization, readability, and maintenance. In the 'ticketReducer', we handle the logic for creating, updating, deleting, and organizing tasks. Implementing everything on one page provides a better understanding of our app.
